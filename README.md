# Sonar Customer Portal

This is a prebuilt and self-hosted customer portal for [Sonar](https://sonar.software).

## Setup

sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get update

git clone (Repo URL)

cd customer_potal

sudo ./install.sh

git pull

update.sh pull/combin

cd/tools & .tools.sh

sudo nano .env


## Quick start

If you are a current Sonar customer, and you need assistance with any part of this process, feel free to contact us at support@sonar.software.

You'll need a machine running Ubuntu 16 or 18 x64. **Please note that the customer portal will not work Ubuntu 19, as Docker is currently unsupported.** The installation script currently assumes a Debian-based distro.
We recommend a minimum of 2 vCPUs and at least 2GB of RAM.

It will need a public facing IP address and a valid domain name pointing to it (e.g. portal.myisp.com).

## Getting started

SSH into your VM.

Install required packages:
`sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade && sudo apt-get -y install git unzip`

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/SonarSoftwareInc/customer_portal.git`

Now change directory into the repository that we've just cloned:
`cd customer_portal`

Run the install script:
`sudo ./install.sh | tee customerportal-install.log`

Follow the instructions as prompted by the installation script.
You can view the installation log by running
`cat customerportal-install.log`

### A note on initial setup

The API username and API password you are prompted for are credentials for your Sonar instance. You should create a dedicated user to utilize for the customer portal - **do not use your admin username/password!** 

**These permissions are different than v1 portal permissions**

* Account create, read, update, and delete permissions
* Ticket create, read, and update permissions, **ticket super user permissions**
* Financial read permissions.

After the setup process is complete, your instance should be up and running. You can navigate to the settings URL (which is `/settings` on the domain you setup, e.g. `https://portal.myisp.com/settings`) and use the settings key that should have been generated for you with the installation script.

## Common tasks

Starting the customer portal:
`sudo docker-compose start`

Stopping the customer portal:
`sudo docker-compose stop`

Viewing the logs:
`sudo docker-compose logs`

## Commands you can use after setup

From the `customer_portal` directory, you can execute `sudo docker-compose exec app /bin/bash` to access the docker container that the portal is running in. After doing this, you can execute the commands below.

* `php artisan sonar:settingskey` will generate a new key for the `/settings` page if you forget the one you had.
* `php artisan sonar:test:smtp {email}` will test your email configuration. Replace `{email}` with your email address, and the portal will attempt to send you a test email.
* `php artisan sonar:test:paypal` will test your PayPal configuration, if it is enabled.

## Upgrading

Upgrades for the customer portal are done automatically and require no interaction on your part! The customer portal will automatically check for updates every 5 minutes and update itself. For further customization such as setting an update window or configuring email and/or Slack notifications, please see https://github.com/v2tec/watchtower

## Troubleshooting

If you get the error `[/var/www/html/storage]:rw': invalid mount config for type "volume": invalid mount path: '[/var/www/html/storage]' mount path must be absolute` during setup, try removing the created storage volume by executing `sudo docker volume rm customer_portal_storage` and rerunning the installation script.

## Customizing the portal

This portal is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). You are welcome to fork and modify this repository for your own needs! Do not attempt to customize the files inside the existing Docker container, as they will be automatically overwritten during upgrade. If you need help customizing this portal beyond what is currently available, call us!
